# STEM Racers?
`STEM Racers` is a game about racing, but with a special twist.
You must design the "AI" that will control the vehicles speed, steering, and decisions.
You'll be doing so through a block style visual programming language (like scratch) 
go head to head, bumper to bumper, and line to line agaisnt your opponents.
And prove you're the best racer, and programmer in the circuit.
